# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose:
Pyber is a ride-sharing app company, and we've been asked to do an exploratory analysis on some   very large CSV files.  Our job is to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city.
  
### Process:
- Create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Matplotlib.
- Add and modify features of Matplotlib charts.
- Add error bars to line and bar charts.
- Determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics.
